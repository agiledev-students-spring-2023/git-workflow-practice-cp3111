### [The Friendship That Made Google Huge](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge)
### What I found interesting:
This article addresses the early members/engineers of Google and the challenges they have faced on their path of becoming the big tech company that they are today. I found it interesting to learn about the "war room" at Google where engineers would lock themselves up debugging, going down all the way to binary code. In addition, the article mentions the development of Hadoop and MapReduce and how it was used to solve one of the biggest issues that Google was facing in its early years. This also caught my eye since Hadoop and MapReduce is still used to process big data today and is even taught at NYU at a different CS elective.
